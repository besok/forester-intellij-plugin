### Task Visualization

The Forester-IntelliJ Plugin offers a task to visualize the tree that brings behavior trees to life. 
Gain valuable insights into your task flows and dependencies through interactive graphical representations. 
This visual aid fosters a better understanding of your task hierarchy, facilitating effective task organization and management.

### Task Simulation

With the task simulation feature, you can run and test your behavior trees directly within the IntelliJ IDE. 
Simulate task executions to verify their correctness and efficiency, enabling you to fine-tune your task orchestration process.

## Usage

### Creating a New Task
